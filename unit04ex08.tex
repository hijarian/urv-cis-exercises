\subsection{Task}
Let G : {0, 1}n → {0, 1}2n be a pseudorandom generator.
Prove that the function G0 : {0, 1}n → {0, 1}6n detailed below is not a pseudorandom generator.

(a) Let s1, . . . , sn be the input of G′.
(b) Compute (y1, . . . , y2n) = G(s1, . . . , sn).
(c) Compute (z1, . . . , z2n) = G(y1, . . . , yn).
(d) Compute (z2n+1, . . . , z4n) = G(yn+1, . . . , y2n).
(e) Output (y1, . . . , y2n, z1, . . . , z2n, z2n+1, . . . , z4n).

\subsection{Solution}

One can see that the output of G0 is a concatenation of two different ``generations'' of G.

As such, we can construct a detector for G0 which checks if the last 4n elements of the output are the result of applying G to the first 2n elements.

This will inevitably lead to a conclusion that the probability of detecting output of G0 is 1 but the probability of applying detector to a truly random string is less than that.
Calculating the exact probability value is an exercise in combinatorics, and is not necessary for the proof.

Therefore, G0 is not a pseudorandom generator. \qed

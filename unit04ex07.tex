\section{Unit 4 Exercise 7}

\subsection{Task}

Let $G : \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^{2n}$ be a pseudorandom generator. Prove that
the function $G' : \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^{4n}$ detailed below is a pseudorandom
generator.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] Let $s_1, \ldots, s_n$ be the input of $G'$.
    \item[b)] Compute $(y_1, \ldots, y_{2n}) = G(s_1, \ldots, s_n)$.
    \item[c)] Compute $(z_1, \ldots, z_{2n}) = G(y_1, \ldots, y_n)$.
    \item[d)] Compute $(z_{2n+1}, \ldots, z_{4n}) = G(y_{n+1}, \ldots, y_{2n})$.
    \item[e)] Output $(z_1, \ldots, z_{2n}, z_{2n+1}, \ldots, z_{4n})$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Solution}

One can argue that it's not possible to construct a distinguisher for $G'$, because at the end of the process, in the output there's no information about the input anymore.

As such, as the output was generated by a pseudorandom generator, it should be pseudorandom as well.

Therefore, $G'$ is a pseudorandom generator. \qed

\subsection{Task}
Suppose that you want to find SHA256 collisions.
(a) Given a string d of 256 bits, make an estimation of how many exe-
cutions you need to perform in order to find an input x satisfying
SHA256(x) = d
(b) Make an estimation of how many executions you would need to
find x and y with SHA256(x) = SHA256(y)
(c) Use openssl or another program to have an estimation of the exe-
cution time of SHA256. Give an estimation of the time (in years)
needed in the previous algorithms.

\section{Exercise 13}

\subsection{Task}
Find real applications that use a key exchange algorithm. Explain
what is the purpose of the algorithm in this application.

\subsection{Solution}

Bluetooth is a good non-obvious example of a real-world application of a key exchange algorithm.

Reading the latest Bluetooth specification~\cite{bluetooth} makes it clear that this technology not only uses the key exchange algorithms, but also actively evolves the approaches to key exchange.
For example, in the version 6.0, section 5.1 Security Architecture(page 309) lists five different key exchange schemes used by Bluetooth over time, culminating in the Secure Connections mechanism which uses P-256 elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange.
